# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This app will be a betting game based on the birthday paradox where users bet on whether someone else in a 23-person game will share their Farcaster birthday. The app will use Next.js, Base's MiniKit, and Farcaster integration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. Main Game UI (extends existing app)
2. Game Joining Interface
3. Betting Interface
4. Game Status Display
5. Results & Notifications Interface

### Backend Components

1. Game Management Service
2. Farcaster Birthday Calculation Service
3. Payment Processing Service
4. Game Resolution Service
5. Notification Service

## Data Model

1. Games Collection

- gameId (unique identifier)
- status (open, full, resolved)
- players (array of player objects)
- createdAt timestamp

2. Player Entry

- fid (Farcaster ID)
- wallet (address)
- farcasterBirthday (timestamp)
- bet (yes/no)
- paid (boolean)
- payout (amount, if any)

## Detailed Work Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

1. Project Configuration

- Review existing MiniKit components
- Keep current wallet connection implementation
- Set up minimal API routes for birthday calculations
- Configure environment variables

2. Data Storage Setup

- Implement TursoDB for game state persistence
- Create database schema for games and players
- Set up data access layer

3. Farcaster Integration

- Implement targeted API call to fetch user data from Farcaster API
- Create birthday calculation utility using the provided algorithm
- Test API integration with existing MiniKit profile components

### Phase 2: Core Game Functionality

4. Game Flow UI

- Create game joining interface
- Implement betting UI (yes/no)
- Develop game status display
- Reuse existing transaction button component

5. Game Management

- Implement function to check for open games with available slots
- Create function to add player to existing game
- Create function to create new game when needed
- Develop bet recording functionality

6. Payment Integration

- Modify existing transaction code to handle 0.5 USDC payments
- Implement payment verification

### Phase 3: Game Resolution

7. Game Check Service

- Create service to check for completed games
- Implement birthday matching algorithm
- Build results calculation logic

8. Notification System

- Use the provided notification code structure
- Create notification templates for game outcomes
- Implement winner notifications

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

9. Testing

- Test full game flow
- Verify transaction handling
- Test notifications

10. Deployment

- Prepare deployment configuration
- Final testing and launch

## Technical Implementation Details

## Farcaster Profile Integration

``` JavaScript
// Using MiniKit's built-in profile viewer
import { useViewProfile } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

// Add the hook
const viewProfile = useViewProfile()

// Add profile button to UI
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={viewProfile}
  className="cursor-pointer bg-transparent font-semibold text-sm pl-2"
>
  PROFILE
</button>
```

### Farcaster Birthday Calculation

``` JavaScript
// API route for fetching Farcaster birthday
export async function getFarcasterBirthday(fid) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://hoyt.farcaster.xyz:2281/v1/userDataByFid?fid=${fid}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    const timestamp = data.messages[0].data.timestamp;
    return decodeFarcasterTimeStamp(timestamp);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching Farcaster birthday:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

function decodeFarcasterTimeStamp(timestamp) {
  const FARCASTER_EPOCH = 1609459200; // Jan 1, 2021
  const unixTime = FARCASTER_EPOCH + timestamp;
  const date = new Date(unixTime * 1000); // JavaScript uses milliseconds
  return date.toISOString();
}
```

### Reusing Existing Components

We'll leverage the existing wallet connection and transaction components:

- Keep the current header with wallet connection
- Adapt the exiting transaction component for the 0.5 USDC bet

### Game Settlement Strategy

For the birthday paradox game with 23 players:

- If any two players share the same Farcaster birthday:

-- Players who bet "Yes" win
-- Distribute winnings proportionally among winning players

- If no players share the same birthday:

-- Players who bet "No" win
-- Distribute winnings proportionally among winning players

Payout calculation should account for:

- Total pool size (23 players Ã— 0.5 USDC = 11.5 USDC)
- Number of winners
- Platform fee (if any)

### Notification Implementation

Using the provided code as a base, we'll implement notifications for:

- Game joining confirmation
- Game filled notification
- Game results and winnings

## Timeline and Milestones

1. Foundation Setup: 1 week

- Project configuration complete
- Data storage implemented
- Farcaster integration working

2. Core Game Logic: 1-2 weeks

- Game management functions working
- Betting system implemented
- Basic UI flow completed

3. Server and Processing: 1 week

- Game checker working
- Settlement logic implemented
- Transaction processing functional

4. Polishing and Testing: 1 week

- UI refinements complete
- Testing completed and bugs fixed
- Ready for deployment

## Key Technical Challenges

### Asynchronous Game Flow

- Handling the asynchronous nature of game filling and resolution
- Managing state across multiple users and sessions

### Payment Processing

- Ensuring secure and reliable USDC transactions
- Verifying payments before game resolution

### Notification Reliability

- Ensuring notifications are delivered to users
- Handling notification failures

### Security Considerations

- Preventing manipulation of birthday data
- Securing financial transactions
