## Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**

Create these environment variables in your deployment platform:

```
# MiniKit Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME="DoppelGamble"
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-app-url.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION="vNext"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ICON_URL="https://your-icon-url.com/icon.png"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL="https://your-image-url.com/image.png"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_IMAGE_URL="https://your-splash-image-url.com/splash.png"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_BACKGROUND_COLOR="ffffff"

# OnchainKit Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Farcaster Frame Manifest
FARCASTER_HEADER="your-farcaster-header"
FARCASTER_PAYLOAD="your-farcaster-payload"
FARCASTER_SIGNATURE="your-farcaster-signature"

# Game Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BET_AMOUNT="0"  # Set to "0" for beta, "0.5" for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_WALLET="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS="0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"

# Database Configuration
TURSO_DATABASE_URL="libsql://your-database-url.turso.io"
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN="your-auth-token"

# Security Keys
RESOLVER_SECRET_KEY="your-resolver-secret-key"
CRON_SECRET_KEY="your-cron-secret-key"
```

2. **Database Initialization**

The database tables will be created automatically on the first call to the `/api/cron` endpoint, but you can also initialize them manually by making a GET request to:

```
https://your-app-url.com/api/cron?key=your-cron-secret-key
```

3. **Farcaster Frame Setup**

After deployment, you need to configure your Farcaster Frame manifest. Run:

```bash
npx create-onchain --manifest
```

And follow the instructions to connect your Farcaster custody wallet and sign the manifest. After signing, you'll get values for:

- FARCASTER_HEADER
- FARCASTER_PAYLOAD
- FARCASTER_SIGNATURE

Add these to your environment variables.

4. **Verification**

Test your deployment by:

- Visiting the app URL
- Connecting your wallet
- Joining a game
- Placing a bet
- Testing the payment flow
- Checking the waiting room status updates

## Monitoring

- Check the application logs for any errors
- Monitor the database for game and player entries
- Verify that the cron job is running every 5 minutes by looking for log entries from `/api/cron`

## Production Deployment

When you're ready to move out of beta mode:

1. Change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BET_AMOUNT` environment variable from "0" to your desired bet amount (e.g., "0.5")
2. Update the game wallet address to your production wallet
3. Consider increasing the frequency of the cron job for faster game resolution

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check the application logs for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure the database connection is working
- Test notifications by using the "NOTIFY" button in the app header
- Check if cron jobs are running by looking at the Vercel logs
